# AggressiveAnimals configuration
#
# Note that this configuration is significantly different from the one provided by Michielcx in the
# first AggressiveAnimals. This version does not rewrite the configuration files if they exist, so
# changes must be made manually. Note that undefined configuration nodes default to the values found
# in the original comments (for sanity, it would be wise not to edit them). The default values will
# be adequate in many cases, so configuration for additional mob-types can be very simple -- for
# example:
# --------------------
# axolotl:
#   enabled: true
# --------------------
# is all that is required; the remaining configuration options will use the default values.

# ========== CHECK FOR UPDATES =====================================================================
# If you do not want notification of available updates in the console log, you may disable it here.
check-for-updates: true

# ========== BSTATS METRICS ========================================================================
# By default, the plugin collects and transmits anonymous statistics to bstats.org.
# Data collection may be disabled here, or generally in the bStats/config.yml.
#
enable-metrics: true

# ========== PER MOB ATTACK PROFILES ===============================================================
# An attack profile must be created for each mob-type that you want to stage revenge attacks.
# Only the enabled node is required. Undefined nodes will use default values.
#
# mob-type:
#   enabled: true                      If true, this mob-type should engage in attacks against players
#   speed-multiplier: 1.0              Multiple of vanilla movement speed (examples: 1.0 is regular speed, 0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is double speed)
#   attack-damage: 1.0                 Damage inflicted on the target on each attack (in half-hearts)
#   attack-damage-limit: 2             If positive, the attacker will always leave the target alive with the specified amount of health (measued in half hearts)
#   attack-speed: 10                   How often a mob can attack the player (in ticks)
#   attack-range: 1                    From how many blocks away can the mob hit the player? (in blocks)
#   attack-leap-height: 0.0            The height to which the mob leaps when attacking (0 or below means disabled)
#   acquisition-range: 16              Distance at which the attaker can detect a target
#   deacquisition-range: 20            Distance at which the victim can escape attack
#   attacker-health-threshold: 5       The attack should stop when the health of the attacker falls below the threshold (in half-hearts)
#   age:                               Attacks may be waged by adults and/or babies
#     adult: true                      If true, adult mobs should attack
#     baby: false                      If true, baby mobs should attack
#   ignore-npcs: true                  If true, ignore NPCs created by NPC managers, such as Citizens, EliteMobs, InfernalMobs, and Shopkeepers
#   named-mobs-only: false             If true, only named mobs may attack
#   always-aggressive: false           If true, mobs should attack only in retaliation for player attack
#   override-targeting: false          If true, remove vanilla targeting behavior and only use attack-conditions
#   group-aggression-range: 20         If other mobs of the same type are within range of the attacker, they should join the attack (in blocks)
#   player-movement:                   Mob should attack if the player is
#     standing: true
#     sneaking: true
#     walking: true
#     sprinting: true
#     looking: true                    Like Enderman
#     sleeping: true
#     gliding: true
#   enabled-worlds: []                 Worlds in which attacks by this mob-type is enabled; if empty, it is enabled in all worlds
#   disabled-worlds:                   Worlds in which attacks by this mob-type is disabled; must be set explicitly; takes precedence over enabled_worlds
#     - "world_example"
