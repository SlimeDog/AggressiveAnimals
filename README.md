# AggressiveAnimals &mdash; Those cute little animals can kill you

### Overview

AggressiveAnimals is based on Michielcx's [original resource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/76716/), which was abandoned after release 2.6 for Minecraft 1.17 (2021-07-10). Credit for the idea belongs to him.

Unfortunately, the original source code was not public, so this resource was created from scratch. The configuration has been modified considerably, so users of the original will need to update, although the defaults will work adequately in most cases.

This resource is released under a GPL3 license.

AggressiveAnimals is completely documented on The Wiki. Please start there when you have questions. https://github.com/SlimeDog/AggressiveAnimals/wiki
