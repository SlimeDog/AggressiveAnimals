## AggressiveAnimals
Those cute little animals can kill you

### Overview

AggressiveAnimals is based on Michielcx's original [AggressiveAnimals](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aggressive-animals-âž¤-mobs-take-revenge-1-8-1-15.76716/), which was abandoned after release 2.6 for Spigot 1.17 (2021-07-10). Credit for the original idea belongs to him.

Unfortunately, the original source code was not public, so this resource was created from scratch. We modified the configuration file slightly, so users of the original AggressiveAnimals may want to update, although the defaults will work adequately.

This resource is released under a GPL3 license.

If Michielcx revives the original AggressiveAnimals, this resource may be discontinued. Or maybe not.
